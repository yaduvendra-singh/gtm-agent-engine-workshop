"""Data-access layer for the GTM assistant.

Thin wrappers over the systems of record: the CRM (product offerings), the
enrichment/intent providers (prospect engagement history, account details, and
tech stack), and the prospect-profile cache. The agent's tools call these
functions rather than touching storage directly.

The underlying records live in ``gtm_records``.

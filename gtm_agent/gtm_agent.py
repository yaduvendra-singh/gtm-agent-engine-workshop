"""GTM assistant agent.

A deep agent (built with ``deepagents.create_deep_agent``) with
seven tools - lookup_offering, build_prospect_profile, get_prospect,
get_current_rep, send_prospect_email, score_prospect, and
update_prospect_info. The tools call the data-access layer in ``data_service`` for
storage and retrieval.

Configure credentials via environment variables or a .env file
(OPENAI_API_KEY, and optionally LANGSMITH_API_KEY / LANGSMITH_PROJECT for
tracing), then call run_agent(...) with a rep request.

Install:
    uv add deepagents langchain langgraph langchain-openai langsmith python-dotenv
